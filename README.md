# AxoloRack, Yet another Eurorack project for Axoloti

  This is a personal project to build an Eurorack extension for Axoloti development board.  
http://www.axoloti.com/

  KiCad, pcb makind techniques, diy electronics, and more.  
then i'll use KiCad because open source
https://www.kicad-pcb.org/

  Axoloti starting Patch templates and maybe Axoloti objects

# The idea
is to put Axoloti in vertical way (cutting the 'midi & pwr' part, then unsolder audio jacks), use GPIO linear 37 pins to connect to a custom Eurorack controller with:
- OLED i2c screen
- one Encoder with pull button
- 4 assignables potometers
- route both input and output to 4 Thonkiconn mono jacks

...

Of course all is Open Source.
