# AxoloRack
Eurorack project for Axoloti.

The idea is to put Axoloti in vertical way, cutting the 'midi & pwr' part, then unsolder audio jacks.
create a controller card with:
- OLED i2c screen
- one Encoder with pull button
- 4 assignables potometers
- route both input and output to 4 Thonkiconn mono jacks

Let's start some schematics with KiCad.
