# The idea
is to put Axoloti in vertical position (cutting the 'midi & pwr' part, then unsolder audio jacks), use GPIO linear 37 pins to connect to a custom Eurorack controller with:
- OLED i2c screen
- one Encoder with pull button
- 4 assignables potometers
- route both input and output to 4 Thonkiconn mono jacks
- 10 HP max
- Loosing nothing Axoloti provide, route all I/O
- Provide patch templates to start, integrate controller with any patch easily
...

Of course all is Open Source.
